## Submit activity evaluation results for Bayesian Method
Click the **Bayesian Methods** tab to start entering software-specific information including the **Number of Function Points (FP)** and **Development and V&V Activity Evaluation Results**.

### Number of Function Points (FP)
The number of Function Points (FP) is a measure of the softwareâ€™s size and complexity. To estimate the number of FPs, please refer to **Table 8-10 "Ratios of Source-code Statements to Function Points for Selected Programming Languages"** in the **U.S.NRC report [1]**.

1. Enter the **Number of FPs**
2. Click the **Next** button to proceed.

### Development and V&V activity evaluation results
To proceed development and V&V activity evaluation, please refer to **Section 4.2.1 "Attribute Nodes"** and **Appendix B "Detailed Attributes of All Phases"** in the **U.S.NRC report [1]**.

> Activity Quality is represented by 3 states: "High", "Medium", and "Low".
1. Enter the activity qualities by drop-down list.
2. Click the **Prev** and **Next** button to go to the previous/next section.
3. After you finish entering the data, click the **Submit** button to submit your results.
